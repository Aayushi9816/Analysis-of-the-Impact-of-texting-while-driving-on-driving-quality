# Analysis-of-the-Impact-of-texting-while-driving-on-driving-quality

The purpose of the report is to look at a study to see how texting while driving affects driving 
quality. The following hypothesis guides the research:
H0: Texting whilst driving has no effect on the participant’s driving quality.
H1: Texting whilst driving has a statistically significant effect on participant’s driving 
quality.

The hypothesis’ conclusion is as follows: Texting whilst driving has a statistically significant 
effect on participant’s driving quality(H1). In this study, there were 32 individuals who were 
asked to complete a driving course in a simulator that contained a variety of obstacles and 
dangers. The data contains the participants' driving ratings, which ranged from 0 (terrible) to 
10 (excellent). Participants completed the driving task with or without a secondary task, such 
as texting while driving (text condition), without any additional work (control condition). It 
was concluded that the tests were clearly confirming the hypothesis after successfully 
satisfying the pre-requisites of cleaning the data by checking for outliers, validating normal 
data distribution of scores, ratio scales, homogeneity of variance, and independent data scores.

Conclusion:
The results of our research show that texting has a statistically significant influence on 
participant driving quality, meaning that texting while driving has a negative impact on driving 
abilities, but focusing only on driving with no other distractions has a favourable effect.
